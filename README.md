# Basic UML of the First iPhone

This directory contains a basic UML diagram representing the architecture and components of the first iPhone. The UML model was created as a requirement for the **Java Developer Training** offered by DIO.

## Overview

The UML provides a simplified view of the core elements and interactions that defined the original iPhone, focusing on its main hardware and software features. It is intended for educational purposes, helping learners understand how to model real-world devices using Unified Modeling Language (UML).

## Contents

- **UML Diagrams**: Visual representation of the main classes, relationships, and system components.
- **Documentation**: Explanations of each part of the diagram and their roles in the iPhone's architecture.

## Usage

Feel free to use these diagrams and documentation as references for your own Java development or UML learning exercises. They are especially helpful for those preparing for or participating in the DIO Java Developer Formation program.
